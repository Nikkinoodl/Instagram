# Instagram
Updated and simplified version of Mario Crippa's 2013 GIMP Instagram plugins. Free to download and use.

This GIMP plugin pulls most of the original Instagram effects into a single file. Deprecated elements in the originals have been
replaced with their current counterparts. Some of the original effects have been simplified and changed to make the plug in more manageable:
for example, borders have been removed entirely and some of the vignettes have been simplified.

I used to use the original version of these plugins to help when painting landscapes from photographs. Some
of the effects were extremely helpful in breaking free of the typical green palette of the Virginia piedmont, 
and they changed the way that I used photography in my artwork. I hope that this new version will, in turn, be of help to others.

To install, copy the file into the following folder and start GIMP.
