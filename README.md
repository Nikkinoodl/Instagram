# Instagram
Updated, consolidated and simplified version of Mario Crippa's 2013 GIMP Instagram plugins. Free to download and use.

This GIMP 2.10 plugin pulls most of the original Instagram effects into a single file. Deprecated elements in the originals have been
replaced with their current counterparts. Some of the original effects have been simplified and changed to make the plugin more manageable:
for example, borders have been removed entirely and some of the vignettes have been simplified.

I have often used the original version of these plugins to help when painting landscapes from photographs. Some
of the effects can be extremely helpful in breaking free of the typical green palette of the Virginia piedmont, 
and they changed the way that I used photography in my artwork. I hope that this new version will, in turn, be of help to others.

To install, download the file the copy it to one of the following hidden locations. If you have not already done do, it is much easier to find these folders if you make them visible â€” in Windows, you can do this from the menu bar in File Explorer.

Windows:

```

C:\user\<username>\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\2.10\plugins

```

Linux:

```

/usr/<username>/.config/GIMP/2.10/plugins

```

And that's all there is to it. Open GIMP and you're now ready to go with your new plugin.
